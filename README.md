</p>

<h2 style="color: #0366d6;">Features</h2>

<ul>
    <li>
        <strong>Stopping and removing containers:</strong> The script checks for running containers and stops them gracefully before removing them using the <code>docker stop</code> and <code>docker rm</code> commands. This prevents any potential issues with active containers during cleanup.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Removing images:</strong> It checks for available Docker images and removes them using the <code>docker rmi</code> command. This helps to free up disk space by removing unused or outdated images.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Removing volumes:</strong> The script checks for existing Docker volumes and removes them using the <code>docker volume rm</code> command. This ensures that any leftover volumes from previous deployments are properly cleaned up.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Cleaning directories:</strong> It removes the contents of directories under <code>/var/lib/docker</code>, which might contain temporary files or artifacts from previous Docker operations.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Handling no resources to remove:</strong> The script includes checks for the presence of containers, images, and volumes. If there are no resources to remove, it displays a message indicating that there are no containers, images, or volumes to remove.
    </li>
    <li>
        <strong>Removing temporary files:</strong> It cleans up temporary files in the <code>/tmp</code> directory, ensuring a clean environment for subsequent operations.
    </li>
</ul>
